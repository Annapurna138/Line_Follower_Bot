It is Arduino MCU based code.
It is labyrinth Maze solver code. 
Maze should consist of black lines on which the bot moves and completes the maze without external help.
It works using the infrared sensors and the principle that black absorbs the light.
Infrared sensors should should be calibrated in such a way that the intensity of rays should be absorbed completely by black only.
